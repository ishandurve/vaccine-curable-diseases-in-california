# vaccine-curable-diseases-in-california
This is a project that analyses the vaccine curable diseases in the state of California, US.
Though it roughly covers over ten diseases, the main focus is on 3 major diseases namely-
1) Meningococcal Disease
2) Hepatitis A
3) Pertussis or Whooping Cough
This project also covers vaccination efoorts over the duration of approximately past 20 years,
and we can witness how whenever vaccination efforts were at their peak, the number of cases went down.
